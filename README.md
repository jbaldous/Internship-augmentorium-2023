# Intership-augmentorium-2023
The goal is to create an augmentorium model for biocontrol.

An augmetorium is a tent where infested fruits are dropped in and where pests are isolates. Only auxiliary insects can escape and enter freely. This technique increase the number of auxiliaries insects as well as the control on pests populations. 

Intership date : 22/05/2023 -- 21/07/2023

## Intership schedule :
- First week (23/05 -- 26/05) : Knowledges on continuous population models for single and interacting species : Courses,python simulations, exercises.
- Second week (30/05 -- 02/06) : Last knowledges on interacting species and begining of theoretical study (without papers) of the multipatch logistic equation. Some articles on the augmentorium to.
- Third week (05/06 -- 09/06) : Python simulations of the multipatch equation in symmetric and assymetric dispersal, knowledges through scientific artciles on the multipatch equation.
- Fourth week (12/06 -- 16/06) : Beginning of the simulation and study of the augmentorium final model (multipatch logistic equation with dispersal and one predator) :
