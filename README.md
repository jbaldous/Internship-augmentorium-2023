# Intership-augmentorium-2023
The goal is to create an augmentorium model for biocontrol.

An augmetorium is a tent where infested fruits are dropped in and where pests are isolates. Only auxiliary insects can escape and enter freely. This technique increase the number of auxiliaries insects as well as the control on pests populations. 

Intership date : 22/05/2023 -- 21/07/2023

## Intership schedule :
- First week (23/05 -- 26/05) : Knowledges on continuous population models for single and interacting species : Courses,python simulations, exercises.
- Second week (30/05 -- 02/06) : Last knowledges on interacting species and begining of theoretical study (without papers) of the multipatch logistic equation. Some articles on the augmentorium to.
- Third week (05/06 -- 09/06) : Python simulations of the multipatch equation in symmetric and assymmetric dispersal, knowledges through scientific articles on the multipatch equation.
- Fourth week (12/06 -- 16/06) : Beginning of the simulation and study of the Freedman model (multipatch logistic equation with dispersal and one predator) : equilibrium and their stability, introduction and justification of the parameters
- Fifth week (19/06 -- 23/06) : Refresh of the two first parts on the multipatch logistic equation with and without assymetrical dispersion and their application with augmentorium technique. Phase plan of the freedman model, mathematical proof of all equilibrium and almost all stability.
- Sixth week (26/06 -- 30/06) :
